Day-19 Constructor chaining
=============================
this()
-------
Usage: this() constructor is used to call another constructor within the same class.

Placement: It must be first statement in the constructor if used. It allows constructor to invoke another constructor to avoid code duplication and manage different initialization scenarios within the same class.

Example: useful when a class has multiple constructors with varying parameters, allowing them to call each other to ensure consistent initialization logic. 

this keyword
-------------
In java this is a reference variable that refers to the current object instance, it can be used in several contexts.

1. To refer to instance variables when there is ambiguity between instance variables and local variables or method parameters this is used to refer current instance variable.
2. To invoke current class method.

Constructor chaining
=====================
You can use this() to call another constructor from within a constructor, and another constructor can call another level constructor within same class, this is nothing but constructor chaining.
